Distributed Multi-Message Threshold (DMMT)

A system that allows decryption if a threshold number of ciphertexts are obtained. An encryptor can create ciphertext with a symmetric key and a chosen threshold value t. If a decryptor obtains t ciphertexts, decryption can be performed. Ciphertexts generated with a key belong to a "domain", which is associated with a threshold value. A domain "owner" is someone who knows its symmetric key. They can then create ciphertexts. A domain owner can also create "shares" (which can be bundled as ciphertexts). If a user learns t shares where t is the threshold of the domain, then he can compute the symmatric key, and then become an "owner" of the domain.

Shamir secret sharing is main underling technique used and is implemented here.

Requires the libraries NTL (libntl) and libgcrypt.
